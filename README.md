## Project Summary
Microsoft announced that they are entering the movie industry and created a new movie studio. However, they are lacking knowledge in the movie making business. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights and recommendations for Microsoft Movie Studios to develop highly profitable and rated movies by using data cleaning and visualization techniques. 

### Questions for consideration:
1. How much should Microsoft budget for a highly profitable movie?
2. What is the most profitable month to release a movie?
3. How much should Microsoft budget for higher ratings?
4. What is the most profitable movie length?
